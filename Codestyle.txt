Coding Style
------------
The coding style used in Vala itself seems to be a variation of the GTK+ coding style.
Tabs rather than spaces.
Tab width unspecified, but 2 works well.
Hanging braces.
Cuddled else.
Braces not necessary for single-line blocks.
Variable and method identifiers in lowercase, words seperated by underscores.
Type identifiers in CamelCase.
Enum members and constants in ALL_CAPS, words seperated by underscores.
C-style /* comments. */
Hungarian notation not used.
Variables often declared without type (i.e. "var").
No line-length limit.
No function-length limit.
Space between method name and parameters' opening parenthesis.
Property "get", "set", "default" declaration all on one line, seperated by semicolons, if default implementations are used.
If properties have implementations, then "get {", "set {" open new lines.
Attributes on their own line.
JavaDoc-style commenting on types, methods, variables.
